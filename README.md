# Daily Planner

On this webpage is a Daily Work Day Planner that allows the user to plan our their day from **9 AM to 5 PM** and can save their notes or plans on their local storage so they can come back to it. 

On this page, there are 9 rows of input lines that users can input what plans they have for that hour of the day. When they are ready, they can save their timeslot to their local storage by clicking the blue button labeled **"Save"**.

There is also a current time above the timeslots so the user can be aware of what time it is relative to their plans.
